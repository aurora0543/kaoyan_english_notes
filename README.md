### 大作文

1. 自信
    
        As we can see from the picture, in a residence community with television antennas on the roof, an upset young man is talking to his friend walking beside him along the street. It is apparent that the former assumes that someone else is more qualified than him.
        Young people tend to give up when the problem is beyond their ability to cope with(迎合). Superficially(表面上的), it seems to be somewhat reasonable, but when weighing in the mind(思考), ***we find there is an apparent tendency behind this phenomenon: the lack of confidence***. Firstly, it is well-known that we exist in a dynamic world with various difficulties. We can do nothing but face them. Secondly, ***attitude is the key point of taking the first step***. Being equipped with bravery and confidence to solve the problem, you will find the question is not as “huge” as you imagine .So, with confidence and the right assessment of difficulties, try and exert(利用) our strength, and then we will overcome all the difficulties.
        On the whole (all in all), I believe we young people should face the difficulties in a right manner. And nothing is impossible to a willing mind.(世上无难事，只怕有心人）
    
2. 合作
    
        As is vividly depicted(描绘) in the picture, wearing the same T-shirt and staff card, four colleagues are standing in their office with a computer and a cup on a desk. The implication(含义) of the cartoon is that teamwork is vital for achieving success in the harsh(残酷的) reality.
        Simple as it is, what the picture conveys to us is thought-provoking(激起). With the development of economy and society, competition is becoming increasingly fierce(凶猛的). It is hard for anyone to finish a task all by himself. Hence, people in mounting numbers put great emphasis on teamwork. In fact, it has been university acknowledged that the ability to work cooperatively with others is the most essential quality that anyone who wants to achieve success should posses.
        Accordingly, it is imperative(重要的) for us to take some measures to enhance the sense of teamwork in our society. Only in this way can we obtain success and only in this way can our world become harmonious(和谐的) for people to live in.
    
3. 考研
    
       In the picture above are two lovely college students. The young man on the left is wondering why the beautiful girl on the right continues to study for a master's degree after college. The girl answers confidently, “With a master's degree, there are a lot more preference choices(更好的选择).”
        There are a great many reasons for my decision to pursue a postgraduate degree. The primary one is that I enjoy learning and acquiring knowledge. As I became a senior student at college, my burning desire for further study became increasingly strong. Secondly, I decided to stay on the academic assembly(机构) line also because of the value of a master's degree. In today's world, where the college population grows rapidly, a master's degree becomes essential if I wish to look for a rewarding job. It ensures me a secure(满足的) future in a tough job market.
        For these reasons, I won't mind spending another three years in the ivory tower(象牙塔), I won't mind giving up opportunities to make money; I won't mind sacrificing(舍弃) many beautiful things in this period of my life.
    
4. 创新
    
        The cartoon depicts that a strong person is trying to find gold out of a huge stone. Holding an ax with his firm hands, he is hewing out of the stone of despair a piece of precious gold. The caption indicates that , “Only through innovation can we make progress, while sticking to old ways means regression(倒退).”
        The purpose of the drawing is to show us that utmost importance should be attached to innovation and creativity. To begin with, the spirit of innovation could be said to be the watchword(口号) or motto of science. Think about the innumerable(数不清的) times a scientific experiment must be carried out, all the laboratory tests, all the live trials, before a new medicine or vaccine(疫苗) is discovered. In addition, many of today's business successes can be attributed to(归因于) innovation. For instance, I personally worked in such a company. It was only after four years and four tries of different business models that its entrepreneur(创业) finally succeeded, and became the chairman of one of the largest Internet companies.
        To sum up, in any field of endeavor, whether it be in medicine, engineering or in business, it seems necessary to put great emphasis on innovation before one can finally achieve success. It is as if life is testing us, testing our innovation and creativity to see if we are really dedicated to(致力于) our dream, before life finally rewards us with success.
    
5. 流行文化
    
        As is vividly depicted(描绘v.) in the portrayal(描绘n.) above, worship(崇拜) for an idol is enjoying striking popularity among adolescents(青少年). In the cartoon, wearing a sweater with “Always Supporting You” on it, a young lady is holding up a board which indicates “Forever love”. beside her, there is another young girl shouting loudly and two other girls crying crazily.
        Undoubtedly, the drawing demonstrates(证明) the social phenomenon of idol worship, which is prevalent(流行) among teenagers nowadays. Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to(倾向于) idolize those who excel in appearance or talent. For instance,  Su Bingtian represents the image of a sports hero, whose handsome appearance and unparalleled(无与伦比的) skills are passionately adored(热爱) by his sports fans. By contrast, many teenage boys and girls win their fame overnight in a great many contests on TV or online, which provokes noisy nationwide debates on the value and harm of admiring these idols.
        In my opinion, idolatry is a double-edged sword which can exert(运用) a profound influence for either good or bad on the growth of young people. If we simply worship them by imitating their hairstyle or pursing fashions unreasonably, the obsession will certainly waste a great deal of our time and money, endangering the efficiency of our study or work. On the contrary, if we endeavor(尝试) to improve ourselves by bridging the gap between our role models and ourselves, we will lead a positive and fruitful life. Accordingly, the latter attitude should be adopted to guide our life.
    
6. 传统文化
    
    The ancient culture of China is one of the great treasures of human civilization. In the picture above, a foreign lady is pleasantly appreciation a traditional Chinese vase in a museum. Obviously, she has been attracted by its elegance.
    In my opinion, the traditional Chinese culture is not only certain to survive, but, in fact, is destined to thrive and prosper. One factor that has already begun to contribute to the preservation of Chinese traditional culture is its commercialization. Another reason that the future of China’s ancient culture can be considered “safe” is the active efforts to protect it on the part of the Chinese government. Finally, Chinese culture is widely supported by the growing international interest in China and its traditions.
    For China, as for any other rapidly developing country, there is a danger that age-old customs and traditions may become lost in the shadows of modernization. If tai chi, kung fu or Peking Opera ever perished from the earth, it would be a tragedy of immeasurable proportions. Fortunately, as a result of successful commercialization efforts, unwavering government support and growing interest overseas, the future of China’s traditional culture will be brighter and more secure than ever before.
    
7. 手机游戏
    
    It is subtly reflected in the caricature that a pathetic boy is being pulled into a smart phone by mobile games. Meanwhile, three huge hands, representing all sectors of society, the school and the family, are exerting every efforts to pull the pitiful boy back from the cell phone. It is apparent that the intention of the cartoon is to illustrate the utmost important e should be attached to the negative effects of mobile games on children.
    The problems that mobile games have brought deserve our serious concern. First and foremost, the most serious harm of cell phone games comes from their contents, which may affect children’s mental fitness. The majority of games involve violence, such as fighting and killing. To defeat or kill their opponents, children are permitted to use various weapons like guns, knives and bombs. When they are enjoying the pleasure of success, a violent turn of mind is developed and rooted in them, which may induce future violent behavior in their real life. What is more, being indulged in cell phone games also does harm to children’s physical health. The radiation from the cell phones can arouse many uncomfortable conditions, like a headache, poor eyesight and even hair loss.
    Of course, it is not the end of the story. Being indulged in smart phone games also affects children’s studies and their communication with others. All these facts indicate that it is time for the whole society to manage and control smart phone games.
    
8. 扶贫
    
    The diagram above clearly reflects that China has made tremendous achievements in poverty alleviation from 2012 to 2020. During this period, China’s impoverished rural population decreased considerably from nearly 100 million to nearly zero, a decline of 100 million. At the same time, the poverty headcount ratio also feel from approximately 10% to almost 0%.
    Several primary factors that account for the above-mentioned changes could be summarized as follows. To begin with, the authorities concerned in China have adopted a combination of conventional and innovative approaches, which have helped improve rural education and health care. What is more, our country has put great emphasis on infrastructure establishment in poverty-stricken rural areas, which has effectively bridged the gap between the rich and the poor. Last but not least, the achievements are attributed to China’s speedy economic development during the past several decades.
    In short, China’s poverty alleviation campaign is particularly vital, both nationally and internationally. First of all, anti-poverty achievements allow more people to enjoy the advantages of its economic boom. In addition, the Chinese government has fulfilled its promise of lifting all people out of poverty.
    
9. 创业
    
    From the information given in the pie chart, we can see the survey on the reasons for starting one’s own business among college students in a certain university. Those whose ideals are to become entrepreneurs account for 44%, the biggest among all the five categories, while those who could not find suitable jobs account for 15%. increasingly, it has become common for university students to start their own businesses prior to graduation.
    As long as they are cautious, this kind of real-world experience can greatly benefit their future careers. Above all, students who launch their own businesses can gain valuable insight into their future career path. Some students may even choose to switch majors as a result of the insight gained from entrepreneurial activities. In addition, regardless of whether a student succeeds or fails in a business venture, the mere fact of having work experience will come in handy when seeking a full-time job after graduation. Employers will regard these students as more ambitious, hard-working and mature than graduates who lack such work experience.
    Despite the benefits to students of “getting their feet wet” in the business world, it is crucial that they maintain academic studies as a top priority. Every student must decide how best to allocate his or her time outside of class. For those with a manageable schedule, exploratory mind and entrepreneurial spirit, work experience prior to graduation can offer important career benefits.
    
10. 材料
    
    Currently, great achievements have been made in the field of artificial intelligence, which is taking over a good many human jobs. In the excerpt, the author assumes that since artificial intelligence can plan and organize for us, our brains will regress. Nevertheless, I disagree with the author’s opinion.
    I cling to the idea that our world won’t be like some science-fiction scenes where human brains are inferior, even if intelligent machines are getting increasingly smarter. To begin with, no matter how superior, artificial intelligence needs us just as much as we need it. In other words, computer-based artificial intelligence has to rely on humans for maintenance to ensure its survival. It also requires our supplies and repairs, hence our brains are going to catch up with the artificial intelligence. What is more, interactions between humans can never be replaced by machines. Although the electronic assistants can plan and organize a dinner party for us, it is beyond their abilities to communicate and interact with human guests in a human manner. For intelligent machines, it is unlikely to develop human-like social competence which consumes a great deal of brain work.
    To sum up, concern about whether artificial intelligence will make our brains regress is caused by an overestimation of the impact of technology on humans and a lack of vision about human intelligence. After all, with the development of artificial intelligence, human brains are also evolving.

1. 投诉信
    
    Dear Sir and Madam,
    
    I write to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received while staying at your hotel during my vacation between the 2nd and 11th of April this year.
    
    Although your hotel is rated as a five-star one, I found that the rooms were not cleaned on a daily basis, and that my bed was cleaned up only every three days. In addition, the food in the restaurant was similarly disappointing. Not only was it extremely overpriced, but the taste was very poor. I was therefore forced to eat out in the local restaurants.
    
    I trust you will take my complaints seriously, and make every effort to improve your service in the future. I would greatly appreciate a discount on my bill (receipt enclosed). I look forward to a favorable reply at your earliest convenience.
    
    Your sincerely,
    
    Li Ming

    Jack,
    I feel most embarrassed about referring to a rather difficult subject. I wonder if it may have slipped your mind that nearly three months ago you asked me for a loan of RMB 500. You said you would pay me back on the next payday. Is it possible that you pay it back within 2 weeks? I am sure you will agree and not be offended by my request.
    Here is a piece of good news for you. The Russian State Ballet, which is now on tour in Beijing, will give a performance in the National Center for the Performing Arts tomorrow evening. I am sure you will be happy to watch it. Here I leave you a ticket. The performance will begin at seven o’ clock sharp. I will expect you at the theater entrance. Please let me know if you can’t make it.
